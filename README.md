## Code Progress 

This section tracks the coding and experimentation journey for this project. Here, I document each method tried, the comparative insights gained, and the rationale behind choosing or discarding certain algorithms:

- **Current Methods**: A summary of all methods tried so far, with notes on their effectiveness.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Key reasons for selecting or ruling out specific algorithms.
