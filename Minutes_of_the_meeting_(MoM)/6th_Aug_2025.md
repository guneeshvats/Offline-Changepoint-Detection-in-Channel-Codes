1. Compare BSC vs AWGN - to be done later 
2. For each plot - have an excel sheet 
    1. Easier to add points and plot AWGN vs BSC together 
3. BSC data generation code - in details
    1. Using BCH codes (for simplicity) in data generation 
4. Basics of LBC 
5. For MATLAB : bchenc, genpoly function 
6. Another approach for CL=31 - should be done by next meeting
7. Writing the code for calculation of h and w(h) 
    1. Use the photo of blackboard - algo 
    2. Update the code from github for data generation. 
    3. write the code independently 
8. After we have the value of minimum weight - w(h) 
9. Howleys’ paper and Hinkleys’ paper combine the results and teh whole pipeline and the whole idea should be there. 
10. Reason for choosing and how - the steps for N’ on the plot
11. Davin - Mean shift : power formula literature 


 By next meeting : 
1. Hinkley’s Paper & result of Worsely 
2. N = 31 
3. Ruptures & CUSUM 

Papers to read now : 
Paper1 - Hinkley
Paper 2 - The power of likelihod ratio and cumulative sum tests for a change in abinomial probability 
Paper 3 - Confidence regions and tests for a changepoint in a sequence of exponential family random variables
