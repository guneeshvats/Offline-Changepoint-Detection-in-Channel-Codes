## 13th August, 2025

1. To compute -'h' with min weight - For LDPC codes - (yet to be discussed) 
2. Also compute for p = 0.1 and 0.2 for all Ts for Codeword length = 31 (See where it stats to fall off) 
3. P00 plot and p'00 plot or show the values being computed - or print them 
4. Do the Hinckley implementation for small value of T. 
5. After we have pl,m (PMF of M) and p'l,m (PMF of M') -- plot this properly - see why the value in left corner always coming in heat plot. 
6. Simulate pin and all other formulas (eqn 3.1) - Complete Hinkley's Implementation
8. Bring all the plot values in CSV (that I am computing for NN of Type 1 or Type 2) - Share those sheet links as well
9. Comfirm the values in the tables of NN Type I for CL = 31
10. Begin for CL = 63 Neural Networks as well
11. Relative Location of predicted CP Plot From the image below..

Next Meeting on Saturday - 16th Aug, 2025
