1. Train all the models again with new number of classes and T = 5, 7, 10 (not more than this) and for Codeword lenght = 15, 31, 63
2. Problem Statement for PMF1 to PMF2 :
3. Plan the whole pipeline from Input sequence of codewords -> processing -> find the window where almost certain there is a changepoint (confidence interval) -> raw codeword domain -> run the window and classify between where the changepoint could lie and from the output labels predict where the first time the label switched from class 1 (belongs to code C1) to next one.
4. the 3 types of plots are -> Accuracy vs p (For various N', fixing W-5,7,10), Accuracy vs N' : (For various ps), Accuracy vs W : For various ps)
5. By next meeting --> Train all models for codeword length = 15 & all BSC parameters (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) and T = 5, 7, 10, and get the desired plots -  (tigsy plots preferrabley)
6. Read upon BCH and LDPC codes and their processing. 
7. Power of the test (To be discussed in next class)
8. Also the approach is that for n=31 we decode with C1 and we decode with C2 and we take the hamming distance of processed sequence vector with decoded sequence and subtract (deoced of both) as shown below and then we can take 2 approaches either PMF1 - PMF2 or demarcate the output labels (all possible subtraction responses) - 0 and 1 and then do the normal processing.
