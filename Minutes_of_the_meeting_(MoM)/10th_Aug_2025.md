1. check ‘h’ either in C1 perp and and not in C2 perp or vice versa (The order matters because where 0.5 ber parameter lies) 
2. 2 types of training 
    1. one is the one that we are doing 
3. Pd Vs T, Pd vs p (BSC), Pd vs N’  (check the photo of what curves are necessary) 
    1. 2 Different types of Neural Networks 
4. Implement Hinkleys paper step by step 
    1. tauo is n on 3rd page 
    2. eqn1 and eqn 2 from the hinkley & photo should match 
    3. see the photo and implement in that pattern/fashion/steps 
5. GLRT Processing : PMF1 — PMF2 (not for now) 
6. pick k1 and k2 such that it has the min - w(h) - for all n : check w(h) 
7. Distr of tauMLE — in worsely 
    1. Eq, 5.2 in latest one — Fk from Lemma 1 and Lemma 2
    2. Focus on these after Wednesday 
    3. in 1983 find Fk recursively 
8. Then we will begin for LDPC 
    1. To do after N = 31
    2. Do it after wednesday

Tuesday - 6-7PM Next meeting
